Live Application: [http://walkerjeffd.shinyapps.io/riffle-conductivity/](http://walkerjeffd.shinyapps.io/riffle-conductivity/)

This repo holds the source code for a [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) application of equations used to measure the conductivity of water using a 555 timer. This app was created  to support development of the [Riffle-ito Water Quality Sensor Platform](https://github.com/p-v-o-s/riffle-ito) and  [Open Water Project](http://openwaterproject.io).
